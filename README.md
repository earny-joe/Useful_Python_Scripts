# _Hey There! And Welcome to Joe's "Python Script Emporium" :nerd_face:_

Recently I realized that I spent quite a bit of time searching for Python scripts from past projects to either repurpose or tweak slightly. So why not store some of these useful scripts in one place? 

That's what this repository will be for! I hope it not only helps when it comes to organizing my projects but that it might help others with theirs as well. Feel free to use any of the following scripts for whatever you may be working on. Live long, and prosper my friends! 

## _Table of Contents_

1. [`data_gather.py`](https://github.com/Jearny58/Useful_Python_Scripts/blob/master/data_gather.py): A Python script that gathers data for a specified Twitter user and returns data in CSV format. Please note: you will need to set up a [Twitter Developer account](https://developer.twitter.com/) to gain access to your keys and tokens! Also, I [set up a `conda` environment](https://uoa-eresearch.github.io/eresearch-cookbook/recipe/2014/11/20/conda/) , which I then stored my keys/tokens in as environment variables. It isn't as hard as it sounds! Just follow along with this [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-hide-your-api-keys-in-python-fb2e1a61b0a0) by Brendan Connelly, and it should be pretty straightforward.
